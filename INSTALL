 SOURCE CODE
 -----------
 Source code can be checked out from ndnx-trace repository.

 $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/ndnx-trace/

 This would create a directory named ndnx-trace


 INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
 ---------------------------
 It is recommended to install both server and client. However, they can be installed individually.

    $ sh bootstrap.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install


 UNINSTALLATION
 --------------
 The program can be uninstalled using make uninstall.

    $ cd ndnx-trace/source
    $ sudo make uninstall


 NON-STANDARD INSTALLATION OF NDNX
 ---------------------------------
 If ndnd is installed in a non-standard directory, 
 
 a) Make sure the NDN_DIR in source/conf.h is set to your ndnx bin directory.
 NDN_DIR = "/Downloads/ndnx-0.8.0/bin/"

 b) For autoconf, use CFLAG (-I) to point to the ndn include directory
 and LDFLAGS (-L) to point to the ndn lib directory.
 
 $ sh bootstrap.sh
 $ ./configure CFLAGS=-I/Downloads/ndnx-0.8.0/include LDFLAGS=-L/Downloads/ndnx-0.8.0/lib
 $ make
 $ make install

IF YOU ARE USING UBUNTU
------------------------------------
There is a bug which needs the -lndn and -lcrypto order to be flipped. If the build fails,
      change the orger in source/Makefile.am and rerun the process.
            
 NOTES
 -----

 o Make sure you have ndnx and openssl-devel installed. Otherwise the installation will fail.

 o Please report installation issues at http://code.google.com/p/ndnx-trace/issues/
